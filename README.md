# Website-Blocker-using-Python
This code helps in blocking websites that might cause distraction during working hours (eg., Facebook).

Note that the main code: website_blocker has the extension 'pyw'. This implies that the code runs in the background. The extension can also be changed to .py mode to run normally. 

This code is set to add facebook.com to list of blocked website lists if time is between 8am to 4pm. This time can be changed in the code.
This code can also be added to task scheduler to run the code at every start up.
